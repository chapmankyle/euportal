# Since the last meeting
- Hendrik managed to configure a virtual environment with a run and build script.

# What was discussed in this meeting
- Each person now needs to start implementing their respective sections of work.
- Decided on a general style that we need to conform to across the platform.

# What needs to be done before the next meeting
- Each of us needs to start coding our section of the front-end.

# Obstacles
- Need to research how to convert from Flask to React using Bootstrap.
